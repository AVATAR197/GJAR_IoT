## Automatic Changelog

1. Copy the changelog template: `template.yml`.
2. Rename the new file to `[author's name].yml` or `[author's name]-[project].yml` or something similar.
3. Fill in the file. Put your name there, as well as a list of changes with their **respective types**. We currently have four change types:
    - add: Additions, new features.
    - remove: Removals, removed/deprecated features.
    - bugfix: Significant bug fix.
    - tweak: Modification, but not an *add* or *remove* and not a *bugfix*. Any other modifications come under this category.
- You can use zero or as many of each change type as you want. An example might look like this:
    ```Yaml
    author: Animal Lover
    changes:
    - add: Added puppies.
    - add: Added kittens.
    - remove: Removed Herobrine.
    - bugfix: Fixed door handle.
    - tweak: Changed door color to blue.
    ```
- Another (minimal) example:
    ```Yaml
    author: Animal Lover
    changes:
    - add: Built a new dog house.
    ```
4. Commit the file with your changes.
